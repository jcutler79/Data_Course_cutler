Lehi = c("Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God
Almighty!  Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and
goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth,
and, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who
come unto thee that they shall perish!",
         "O that thou mightest be like unto this river, continually running
         into the fountain of all righteousness!",
         "O that thou mightest be like unto this valley, firm and steadfast, and immovable in keeping
         the commandments of the Lord!",
         "Behold I
have dreamed a dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me
         that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem.
         
         1 Nephi 3:3
         3 For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a
         genealogy of my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of
         brass.
         
         1 Nephi 3:4
         4 Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy
         brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records,
         and bring them down hither into the wilderness.
         
         1 Nephi 3:5
         5 And now, behold thy brothers murmur, saying it is a hard thing
         which I have required of them; but behold I have not required it
         of them, but it is a commandment of the Lord.
         
         1 Nephi 3:6
         6 Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord,
         because thou hast not murmured.",
         "I know that I am a visionary man; for if I had not seen the
things of God in a vision I should not have known the goodness of
         God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my
         brethren.
         
         1 Nephi 5:5
         5 But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which
         things I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver
         my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto
         us in the wilderness.",
         "Behold, I have dreamed a
dream; or, in other words, I have seen a vision.
         
         1 Nephi 8:3
         3 And behold, because of the thing which I have seen, I have
         reason to rejoice in the Lord because of Nephi and also of Sam;
         for I have reason to suppose that they, and also many of their
         seed, will be saved.
         
         1 Nephi 8:4
         4 But behold, Laman and Lemuel, I fear exceedingly because of
         you; for behold, methought I saw in my dream, a dark and dreary
         wilderness.
         
         1 Nephi 8:5
         5 And it came to pass that I saw a man, and he was dressed in a
         white robe; and he came and stood before me.
         
         1 Nephi 8:6
         6 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, and bade me follow
         him.
         
         1 Nephi 8:7
         7 And it came to pass that as I followed him I beheld myself
         that I was in a dark and dreary waste.
         
         1 Nephi 8:8
         8 And after I had traveled for the space of many hours in
         darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord that he would have mercy
         on me, according to the multitude of his tender mercies.
         
         1 Nephi 8:9
         9 And it came to pass after I had prayed unto the Lord I beheld
         a large and spacious field.
         
         1 Nephi 8:10
         10 And it came to pass that I beheld a tree, whose fruit was
         desirable to make one happy.
         
         1 Nephi 8:11
         11 And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the
         fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all
         that I ever before tasted.  Yea, and I beheld that the fruit
         thereof was white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever
         seen.
         
         1 Nephi 8:12
         12 And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with
         exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my
         family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was
         desirable above all other fruit.
         
         1 Nephi 8:13
         13 And as I cast my eyes round about, that perhaps I might
         discover my family also, I beheld a river of water; and it ran
         along, and it was near the tree of which I was partaking the
         fruit.
         
         1 Nephi 8:14
         14 And I looked to behold from whence it came; and I saw the
         head thereof a little way off; and at the head thereof I beheld
         your mother Sariah, and Sam, and Nephi; and they stood as if they
         knew not whither they should go.
         
         1 Nephi 8:15
         15 And it came to pass that I beckoned unto them; and I also did
         say unto them with a loud voice that they should come unto me,
         and partake of the fruit, which was desirable above all other
         fruit.
         
         1 Nephi 8:16
         16 And it came to pass that they did come unto me and partake of
         the fruit also.
         
         1 Nephi 8:17
         17 And it came to pass that I was desirous that Laman and Lemuel
         should come and partake of the fruit also; wherefore, I cast mine
         eyes towards the head of the river, that perhaps I might see
         them.
         
         1 Nephi 8:18
         18 And it came to pass that I saw them, but they would not come
         unto me and partake of the fruit.
         
         1 Nephi 8:19
         19 And I beheld a rod of iron, and it extended along the bank of
         the river, and led to the tree by which I stood.
         
         1 Nephi 8:20
         20 And I also beheld a strait and narrow path, which came along
         by the rod of iron, even to the tree by which I stood; and it
         also led by the head of the fountain, unto a large and spacious
         field, as if it had been a world.
         
         1 Nephi 8:21
         21 And I saw numberless concourses of people, many of whom were
         pressing forward, that they might obtain the path which led unto
         the tree by which I stood.
         
         1 Nephi 8:22
         22 And it came to pass that they did come forth, and commence in
         the path which led to the tree.
         
         1 Nephi 8:23
         23 And it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness; yea,
         even an exceedingly great mist of darkness, insomuch that they
         who had commenced in the path did lose their way, that they
         wandered off and were lost.
         
         1 Nephi 8:24
         24 And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward,
         and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of
         iron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness,
         clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and
         partake of the fruit of the tree.
         
         1 Nephi 8:25
         25 And after they had partaken of the fruit of the tree they did
         cast their eyes about as if they were ashamed.
         
         1 Nephi 8:26
         26 And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other
         side of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it
         stood as it were in the air, high above the earth.
         
         1 Nephi 8:27
         27 And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male
         and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and
         they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers
         towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit.
         
         1 Nephi 8:28
         28 And after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed,
         because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away
         into forbidden paths and were lost.
         
         1 Nephi 8:29
         29 And now I, Nephi, do not speak all the words of my father.
         
         1 Nephi 8:30
         30 But, to be short in writing, behold, he saw other multitudes
         pressing forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the
         rod of iron; and they did press their way forward, continually
         holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell
         down and partook of the fruit of the tree.
         
         1 Nephi 8:31
         31 And he also saw other multitudes feeling their way towards
         that great and spacious building.
         
         1 Nephi 8:32
         32 And it came to pass that many were drowned in the depths of
         the fountain; and many were lost from his view, wandering in
         strange roads.
         
         1 Nephi 8:33
         33 And great was the multitude that did enter into that strange
         building.  And after they did enter into that building they did
         point the finger of scorn at me and those that were partaking of
         the fruit also; but we heeded them not.")


the_Lord = c("Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast
sought me diligently, with lowliness of heart.
             
             1 Nephi 2:20
             20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall
             prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land
             which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above
             all other lands.
             
             1 Nephi 2:21
             21 And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, they
             shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.
             
             1 Nephi 2:22
             22 And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou shalt
             be made a ruler and a teacher over thy brethren.
             
             1 Nephi 2:23
             23 For behold, in that day that they shall rebel against me, I
             will curse them even with a sore curse, and they shall have no
             power over thy seed except they shall rebel against me also.
             
             1 Nephi 2:24
             24 And if it so be that they rebel against me, they shall be a
             scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in the ways of
             remembrance.",
             )


angel1 = "Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod? 
Know ye not that the Lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you,
and this because of your iniquities?  Behold ye shall go up to
Jerusalem again, and the Lord will deliver Laban into your hands."


Laman_and_Lemuel = "How is it possible that the Lord will
deliver Laban into our hands?  Behold, he is a mighty man, and he
can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?"


the_Spirit = c("Behold the Lord hath
delivered him into thy hands.",
               "Slay
him, for the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands;
               
               1 Nephi 4:13
               13 Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his
               righteous purposes.  It is better that one man should perish than
               that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.")


Sariah = c("Behold thou hast led us forth
from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we
           perish in the wilderness.",
           "Now I know of a surety that the Lord
hath commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I
           also know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my sons, and
           delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them power
           whereby they could accomplish the thing which the Lord hath
           commanded them.")
