### Headaches

## Testing to see whether drinking at least two glasses of water immediately after waking
# up has any effect on headaches, as well as basic tracking of headache frequency and 
# regularity.

## 5 May 2018 - Saturday
# Took headache medicine
# Went on a walk up Provo Canyon with dad that morning (9am to 11am)
# Did feel a little thirsty on the walk; only got to drink twice--at drinking fountain

## 7 May 2018 - Monday
# In the morning I felt like I was going to get a headache. It was probably just sinus pressure (got a tiny cold from William).

## 24 June 2018 - Sunday
# Couldn't tell for sure if I was really going to have a headache or not. It never got that serious. 
# Took generic Excedrin at 5:30pm
