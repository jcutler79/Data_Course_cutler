### Principles of statistics


## QUESTIONS:
## 1. How does it make sense that MSE should be an unbiased estimator of sigma^2? (DAE 3.4.5)
## 2. 


## 1. A p-value is the probability of getting our particular sample by chance when the null hypothesis is true 
## 2. The significance level is the probability (alpha) that we mistakenly reject the null; isn't
# this the type I error?
## 3. Yit is a random variable that represents the response obtained on the 't'th observation
# of the 'i'th treatment.

## F distribution: The test statistic MST/MSE has an F distribution if the null hypothesis is
# correct. But if the null is false, then MST/MSE has a related distribution called a noncentral
# F distribution. The noncentral F distribution is denoted by F(v-1),(n-v),(delta^2), where 
# delta^2 is called the noncentrality parameter and is defined to be:
 # delta^2 = (v-1)*Q(Ti)/sigma^2

## P value: 
## Power of the test: The power of the test is the probability of rejecting [a false] Hnot (DAE
# 3.6.2).
# "Statistical power is inverseley related to beta (the probability of making a type II error).
# In short, power = 1 - beta." - The internet.
## Power of the test at Delta: The power of the test at Delta, denoted by pi(Delta), is the
# probability of rejecting Hnot when the effects of at least two of the txs differ by Delta.
# (Think of the battery life example in DAE-3.6.2, paragraph 1.) The power of the test pi(Delta)
# is a function of:
 # the difference, Delta
 # sample sizes, ri
 # number of txs, v
 # the significance level, alpha
 # and the error variance, sigma^2
# Consequently, the sample sizes can be determined if pi(Delta), v, alpha, and sigma^2 are known.
# The values of Delta, pi(Delta), v, and alpha are chosen by the experimenter, but the error
# variance has to be guessed using data from a pilot study or another similar experiment. In
# general, the largest likely value of sigma^2 should be used. If the guess for sigma^2 is too
# small, the power of the test will be smaller than the specified pi(Delta). If the guess for 
# sigma^2 is too high, then the power will be higher than needed, and differences in the Ti's
# smaller than Delta will cause Hnot to be rejected with high probability.
