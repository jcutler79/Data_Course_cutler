## Ideas for future flashcard decks:
# The Enlightenment - the history, the philosophy, the people, the ideas, the values, the polemic (what were they reacting to or arguing against; i.e. not just what were they for, but what traditional ideas were they against)
# Socialism - socialism vs communism; empirical facts about socialist phenomena; misconceptions
# Capitalism - Chomsky facts about; history; ideas; values; misconceptions
# Political right vs left - what are the left wing ideas, phenomena, practices, etc.? what are the right wing ones? Have they ever changed? When did right and left emerge in political philosophy?

## SEPARATE FROM THE REST OF THE DECKS - USMLE step 1 (15 categories + high yield):

Josephus Flavius identified the Moschoi with the Biblical Meshech. ***Assyrian sources identify the Western Mushki with the Phrygians,*** but Greek sources clearly distinguish between the Phrygians and the Moschoi. The Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture notes that the Armenians according to Diakonoff, are then an amalgam of the Hurrian (and Urartians), Luvians and the Proto-Armenian Mushki (or Armeno-Phrygians) who carried their IE language eastwards across Anatolia.According to Greek mythographers,[9] the first Phrygian Midas had been king of the Moschi (Mushki), also known as Bryges (Brigi) in the western part of archaic Thrace.Assyrian sources from the 8th century BC speak of a king Mita of the Mushki, identified with king Midas of Phrygia. The Phrygians were an ancient Indo-European people, initially dwelling in the southern Balkans â€“ according to Herodotus â€“ under the name of Bryges (Briges), changing it to Phryges after their final migration to Anatolia, via the Hellespont. - Wikipedia 'Mushki' and 'Phrygians'")

This study shows that annual European lead emissions closely varied with historical events, like imperial expansion, wars, and major plagues.","Emissions rose coeval with Phoenician expansion, and reached a maximum under the Roman Empire.","Their results indicate sustained economic growth during the first two centuries of the Roman Empire, terminated by the 2nd century Antonine plague.","Materials/Methods (M/M): They analyzed parts of the NGRIP2 ice core--originally collected in 1998--using the DRI's continuous melter system.","M/M cont.: The DRI ice-core analytical system includes two high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers (HR-ICP-MS) operating in parallel. These MSs, along with a lot of other instruments, are capable of simultaneous measurements of ~30 elements, isotopes, and chemical species.","M/M cont.: All measurements were exactly coregistered in depth.","M/M cont.: The part of the NGRIP2 core they examined was between depths 160 m and 580 m. They got 21,000 low (~9 samples / a --meaning 9 samples per year!) and 48,000 medium (~19 samples / a) slit resolution measurements of lead. This afforded them an effective depth resolution for the HR-ICP-MS measurements of .015 m, equivalent to ~12 samples/a during the Roman era.","M/M cont.: Lead concentration detection limits (defined as 3xs the SD of the blank??) were .01 and .18 pg/g--well below the average NGRIP2 lead concentrations of 1.4 and 3 pg/g during background (1100-1000 BC) and Roman periods. Concentrations ranged from .4 pg/g to more than 20 pg/g during these periods.","M/M cont.: It was *assumed* that total lead comprised three components: 1) crustal lead from windblown dust, 2) volcanic lead largely from quiescent emissions, and 3) pollution lead. Deriving the crustal and voclanic lead levels is an interesting, not too lengthy story.

The loss of Korean lives is never once brought up.)?","Answer: The natural dividend of saving the South was the evolution of today's democratic and prosperous South Korea.

South Korea is a model global citizen and a strong ally of the US, standing in stark contrast to [the hole that is] North Korea.
