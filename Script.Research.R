# Script.Research - all new methods and algorithms for research OT, NT, BofM text

# (functions from NT.OT.BofM.research will be used here)

# Libraries:
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(pracma) # for the strcmp function for comparing two strings to see if they're identical
library(dplyr) # for filtering data frames


# The texts:
load("/Users/jamescutler/Desktop/Data_Course_cutler/The_real_KJNT.RData")
load("/Users/jamescutler/Desktop/Data_Course_cutler/The_real_KJOT.RData")
load("/Users/jamescutler/Desktop/Data_Course_cutler/real_bofm.RData") # Load bkofm, the one with the multiple spaces problem fixed




# Name frequency in the OT

# New get.passages function with very little surrounding text (for names):
get.passages.names = function(aword,abook,todos = TRUE){
