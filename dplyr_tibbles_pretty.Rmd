## Descriptive statistics:
```{r results='asis'}


tib1 = smoke %>%
  count(sex,smoke) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  mutate(prop = prop.table(n))
tib2 = smoke %>%
  count(smoke,sex) %>%
  group_by(smoke) %>%
  mutate(prop = prop.table(n))
summary_table(tib1) # FUNNY HOW THIS ALMOST DOES WHAT I WANTED IT TO DO

```

### There are more female smokers than male (39 to 26). There are more male nonsmokers than female (310 to 279).
