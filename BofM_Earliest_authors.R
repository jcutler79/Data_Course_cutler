Nephi = c("the book of Nephi his reign and ministry an account of Lehi and his wife Sariah and 
          his four sons being called beginning at the eldest Laman Lemuel Sam and Nephi the Lord
          warns Lehi to depart out of the land of Jerusalem because he prophesieth unto the people
          concerning their iniquity and they seek to destroy his life he taketh three days journey
          into the wilderness with his family Nephi taketh his brethren and returns to the land of
          Jerusalem after the record of the Jews the account of their sufferings they take the 
          daughters of Ishmael to wife they take their families and depart into the wilderness
          their sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness the course of their travels they come
          to the large waters Nephis brethren rebelleth against him he confoundeth them and buildeth
          a ship they call the name of the place Bountiful they cross the large waters into the 
          promised land etc this is according to the account of Nephi or in other words i Nephi 
          wrote this record i Nephi having been born of goodly parents therefore i was taught
          somewhat in all the learning of my father and having seen many afflications in the course
          of my days nevertheless having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days yea having
          had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God therefore i make a record
          of my proceedings in my days yea i make a record in the language of my father which 
          consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians and i know that the
          record which i make to be true and i make it with mine own hand and i make it according to
          my knowledge for it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of the reign of 
          Zedekiah king of Judah my father Lehi having dwelt at Jerusalem in all his days and in 
          that same year there came many prophets prophesying unto the people that they must repent
          or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed wherefore it came to pass that my father
          Lehi as he went forth prayed unto the Lord yea even with all his heart in behalf of his
          people and it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord there came a pillar of fire and dwelt
          upon a rock before him and he saw and heard much and because of the things which he saw
          and heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly and it came to pass that he returned to his
          own house at Jerusalem and he cast himself upon his bed being overcome with the Spirit and 
          the things which he had seen and being thus overcome with the Spirit he was carried away in
          a vision even that he saw the heavens open and he thought he saw God sitting upon his throne
          surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising
          their God and it came to pass that he saw one descending out of the midst of heaven and he
          beheld that his luster was above that of the sun at noonday and he also saw twelve others 
          following him and their brightness did exceed that of the stars in the firmament and they 
          came down and went forth upon the face of the earth and the first came and stood before my
          father and gave unto him a book and bade him that he should read and it came to pass that as
          he read he was filled with the Spirit of the Lord and he read saying","")
