### Earliest text of the Book of Mormon

Nephi = c("the book of Nephi his reign and ministry an account of Lehi and his wife Sariah and 
          his four sons being called beginning at the eldest Laman Lemuel Sam and Nephi the Lord
          warns Lehi to depart out of the land of Jerusalem because he prophesieth unto the people
          concerning their iniquity and they seek to destroy his life he taketh three days' journey
          into the wilderness with his family Nephi taketh his brethren and returns to the land of
          Jerusalem after the record of the Jews the account of their sufferings they take the 
          daughters of Ishmael to wife they take their families and depart into the wilderness
          their sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness the course of their travels they come
          to the large waters Nephis brethren rebelleth against him he confoundeth them and buildeth
          a ship they call the name of the place Bountiful they cross the large waters into the 
          promised land etc this is according to the account of Nephi or in other words i Nephi 
          wrote this record i Nephi having been born of goodly parents therefore i was taught
          somewhat in all the learning of my father and having seen many afflications in the course
          of my days nevertheless having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days yea having
          had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God therefore i make a record
          of my proceedings in my days yea i make a record in the language of my father which 
          consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians and i know that the
          record which i make to be true and i make it with mine own hand and i make it according to
          my knowledge for it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of the reign of 
          Zedekiah king of Judah my father Lehi having dwelt at Jerusalem in all his days and in 
          that same year there came many prophets prophesying unto the people that they must repent
          or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed wherefore it came to pass that my father
          Lehi as he went forth prayed unto the Lord yea even with all his heart in behalf of his
          people and it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord there came a pillar of fire and dwelt
          upon a rock before him and he saw and heard much and because of the things which he saw
          and heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly and it came to pass that he returned to his
          own house at Jerusalem and he cast himself upon his bed being overcome with the Spirit and 
          the things which he had seen and being thus overcome with the Spirit he was carried away in
          a vision even that he saw the heavens open and he thought he saw God sitting upon his throne
          surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising
          their God and it came to pass that he saw one descending out of the midst of heaven and he
          beheld that his luster was above that of the sun at noonday and he also saw twelve others 
          following him and their brightness did exceed that of the stars in the firmament and they 
          came down and went forth upon the face of the earth and the first came and stood before my
          father and gave unto him a book and bade him that he should read and it came to pass that as
          he read he was filled with the Spirit of the Lord and he read saying","yea and many things did
          my father read concerning Jerusalem that it should be destroyed and the inhabitants thereof
          many should perish by the sword and many should be carried away captive into Babylon and it 
          came to pass that when my father had read and saw many great and marvelous things he did 
          exclaim many things unto the Lord such as","and after this manner was the language of my 
          father in the praising of his God for his soul did rejoice and his whole heart was filled
          because of the things which he had seen yea which the Lord had shewn unto him and now i Nephi
          do not make a full account of the things which my father hath written for he hath written
          many things which he prophesied and spake unto his children of which i shall not make a full
          account but i shall make an account of my proceedings in my days behold i make an abridgment
          of the record of my father upon plates which i have made with mine own hands wherefore after
          that i have abridged the record of my father then will i make an account of mine own life
          therefore i would that ye should know that after the Lord had shewn so many marvelous things
          unto my father Lehi yea concerning the destruction of Jerusalem behold he went forth among
          the people and began to prophesy and to declare unto them concerning the things which he had
          both seen and heard and it came to pass that the Jews did mock him because of the things which
          he testified of them for he truly testified of their wickedness and abominations and he 
          testified that the things which he saw and heard and also the things which he read in the book
          manifested plainly of the coming of a Messiah and also the redemption of the world and when the
          Jews heard these things they were angry with him yea even as with the prophets of old whom they
          had cast out and stoned and slain and they also sought his life that they might take it away
          but behold i Nephi will shew unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord is over all them
          whom he hath chosen because of their faith to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance
          for behold it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my father yea even in a dream and saith unto
          him","and it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father even in a dream that he should take
          his family and depart into the wilderness and it came to pass that he was obedient unto the 
          word of the Lord wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him and it came to pass that he 
          departed into the wilderness and he left his house and the land of his inheritance and his 
          gold and his silver and his precious things and took nothing with him save it were his family 
          and provisions and tents and he departed into the wilderness and he came down by the borders
          near the shore of the Red Sea and he traveled in the wilderness in the borders which was 
          nearer the Red Sea and he did travel in the wilderness with his family which consisted of my
          mother Sariah and my elder brethren which were Laman Lemuel and Sam and it came to pass that
          when he had traveled three days in the wilderness he pitched his tent in a valley beside a
          river of water and it came to pass that he built an altar of stones and he made an offering
          unto the Lord and gave thanks unto the Lord our God and it came to pass that he called the 
          name of the river Laman and it emptied into the Red Sea and the valley was in the borders
          near the mouth thereof and when my father saw that the waters of the river emptied into the
          fountain of the Red Sea he spake unto Laman saying","and he also spake unto Lemuel saying","now
          this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of Laman and Lemuel for behold they did murmur in
          many things against their father because that he was a visionary man and that he had led them out
          of the land of Jerusalem to leave the land of their inheritance and their gold and their silver 
          and their precious things and to perish in the wilderness and this they said that he had done 
          because of the foolish imaginations of his heart and thus Laman and Lemuel being the eldest did
          murmur against their father and they did murmur because they knew not the dealings of that God
          who had created them neither did they believe that Jerusalem that great city could be destroyed
          according to the words of the prophets and they were like unto the Jews which were at Jerusalem
          which sought to take away the life of my father and it came to pass that my father did speak 
          unto them in the valley of Lemuel with power being filled with the Spirit until their frames did
          shake before him and he did confound them that they durst not utter against him wherefore they 
          did do as he commanded them and my father dwelt in a tent and it came to pass that i Nephi being
          exceedingly young nevertheless being large in stature and also having great desires to know of
          the mysteries of God wherefore i cried unto the Lord and behold he did visit me and did soften
          my heart that i did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father wherefore i did not
          rebel against him like unto my brothers and i spake unto Sam making known unto him the things
          which the Lord had manifested unto me by his Holy Spirit and it came to pass that he believed
          in my words but behold Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto my words and being grieved 
          because of the hardness of their hearts i cried unto the Lord for them and it came to pass that
          the Lord spake unto me saying","and it came to pass that i Nephi returned from speaking with 
          the Lord to the tent of my father and it came to pass that he spake unto me saying","and it 
          came to pass that i Nephi said unto my father i will go and do the things which the Lord hath
          commanded for i know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men save he shall
          prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them and it came
          to pass that when my father had heard these words he was exceeding glad for he knew that i had
          been blessed of the Lord and i Nephi and my brethren took our journey in the wilderness with
          our tents to go up to the land of Jerusalem and it came to pass that when we had gone up to the
          land of Jerusalem i and my brethren did consult one with another and we cast lots which of us
          should go in unto the house of Laban and it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman and Laman
          went in unto the house of Laban and he talked with him as he sat in his house and he desired of
          Laban the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass which contained the genealogy of
          my father and behold it came to pass that Laban was angry and thrust him out from his presence
          and he would not that he should have the records wherefore he said unto him","but Laman fled
          out of his presence and told the things which Laban had done unto us and we began to be 
          exceeding sorrowful and my brethren were about to return unto my father in the wilderness but
          behold i said unto them that as the Lord liveth and as we live we will not go down unto our
          father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us
          wherefore let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord therefore let us go down
          to the land of our father's inheritance for behold he left gold and silver and all manner of
          riches and all this he hath done because of the commandment for he knowing that Jerusalem must
          be destroyed because of the wickedness of the people for behold they have rejected the words of
          the prophets wherefore if my father should dwell in the land after that he hath been commanded
          to flee out of the land behold he would also perish wherefore it must needs be that he flee out
          of the land and behold it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these records that we might
          preserve unto our children the language of our fathers and also that we may preserve unto them
          the words which have been spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets which have been delivered
          unto them by the Spirit and power of God since the world began even down unto this present time
          and it came to pass that after this manner of language did i persuade my brethren that they
          might be faithful in keeping the commandments of God and it came to pass that we went down to
          the land of our inheritance and we did gather together our gold and our silver and our precious
          things and after that we had gathered these things together we went up again unto the house of
          Laban and it came to pass that we went in unto Laban and desired him that he would give unto us
          the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass for which we would give unto him our
          gold and our silver and all our precious things and it came to pass that when Laban saw our
          property that it was exceeding great he did lust after it insomuch that he thrust us out and
          sent his servants to slay us that he might obtain our property and it came to pass that we did
          flee before the servants of Laban and we were obliged to leave behind our property and it fell
          into the hands of Laban and it came to pass that we fled into the wilderness and the servants
          of Laban did not overtake us and we hid ourselves in the cavity of a rock and it came to pass
          that Laman was angry with me and also with my father and also was Lemuel for he hearkened unto
          the words of Laman wherefore Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard words unto us their younger
          brothers and they did smite us even with a rod and it came to pass that as they smote us with a
          rod behold an angel of the Lord came and stood before them and he spake unto them saying","and 
          after that the angel spake unto us, he departed and after that the angel had departed Laman 
          and Lemuel again began to murmur saying","and it came to pass that i spake unto my brethren
          saying let us go up again unto Jerusalem and let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of
          the Lord for behold he is mightier than all the earth then why not mightier than Laban and his
          fifty yea or even than his tens of thousands therefore let us go up let us be strong like unto
          Moses for he truly spake unto the waters of the Red Sea and they divided hither and thither and
          our fathers came through out of captivity on dry ground and the armies of Pharaoh did follow 
          and were drownded in the waters of the Red Sea now behold ye know that this is true and also ye
          know that an angel hath spoken unto you wherefore can ye doubt let us go up the Lord is able to
          deliver us even as our fathers and to destroy Laban even as the Egyptians now when i had spoken
          these words they was yet wroth and did still continue to murmur nevertheless the did follow me
          up until we came without the walls of Jerusalem and it was by night and i caused that they 
          should hide themselves without the wall and after that they had hid themselves i Nephi crept 
          into the city and went forth towards the house of Laban and i was led by the Spirit not knowing
          beforehand the things which i should do nevertheless i went forth and as i came near unto the
          house of Laban i beheld a man and he had fallen to the earth before me for he was drunken with
          wine and when i came to him i found that it was Laban and i beheld his sword and i drew it forth
          from the sheath thereof and the hilt thereof was of pure gold and the workmanship thereof was
          exceeding fine and i saw that the blade thereof was of the most precious steel and it came to
          pass that i was constrained by the Spirit that i should kill Laban but i said in my heart never
          at any time have i shed the blood of man and i shrunk and would that i might not slay him and
          the Spirit saith unto me again","yea and i 
          also knew that he had sought to take away mine own life yea and he would not hearken unto the
          commandments of the Lord and he also had taken away our property and it came to pass that the 
          Spirit said unto me again","and now when i Nephi had heard these words i remembered the words
          of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness saying that","yea and i also thought that
          they could not keep the commandments of the Lord according to the law of Moses save they should
          have the law and i also knew that the law was engraven upon the plates of brass and again i 
          knew that the Lord had delivered Laban into my hands for this cause that i might obtain the 
          record according to his commandments therefore i did obey the voice of the Spirit and took 
          Laban by the hair of the head and i smote off his head with his own sword and after that i had
          smote off his head with his own sword i took the garments of Laban and put them upon mine own
          body yea even every whit and i did gird on his armor about my loins and after i had done this
          i went forth unto the treasury of Laban and as i went forth towards the treasury of Laban 
          behold i saw the servant of Laban which had the keys of the treasury and i commanded him in the
          voice of Laban that he should go with me into the treasury and he supposing me to be his master
          Laban for he beheld the garments and also the sword girded bout my loins and he spake unto me
          concerning the elders of the Jews he knowing that his master Laban had been out by night among
          them and i spake unto him as if it had been Laban and i also spake unto him that i should carry
          the engravings which were upon the plates of brass to my elder brethren which were without the
          wall and i also bade him that he should follow me and he supposing that i spake of the brethren
          of the church and that i was truly that Laban whom i had slew wherefore he did follow me and he
          spake unto me many times concerning the elders of the Jews as i went forth unto my brethren
          which were without the wall and it came to pass that when Laman saw me he was exceedingly 
          frightened and also Lemuel and Sam and they fled from before my presence for they supposed it 
          was Laban and that he had slain me and had sought to take away their lives also and it came to
          pass that i called ater them and they did hear me wherefore they did cease to flee from my 
          presence and it came to pass that when the servant of Laban beheld my brethren he began to 
          tremble and was about to flee before me and return to the city of Jerusalem and now i Nephi
          being a man large in stature and also having received much strength of the Lord therefore i did
          seize upon the servant of Laban and held him that he should not flee and it came to pass that i
          spake with him that if he would hearken unto my words as the Lord liveth and as i live even so
          that if he would hearken unto our words we would spare his life and i spake unto him even with 
          an oath that he need not fear that he should be a free man like unto us if he would go down into
          the wilderness with us and i also spake unto him saying surely the Lord hath commanded us to do
          this thin and shall we not be diligent in keeping the commandment of the Lord therefore if thou
          wilt go down into the wilderness to my father thou shalt have place with us and it came to pass
          that Zoram did take courage at the words which i spake now Zoram was the name of the servant
          and he promised me that he would go down into the wilderness unto our father yea and he also 
          made an oath unto us that he would tarry with us from that time forth now we were desirous that
          he should tarry with us for this cause that the Jews might not know concerning our flight into
          the wilderness lest they should pursue us and destroy us and it came to pass that when Zoram
          had made an oath unto us our fears did cease concerning him and it came to pass that we took 
          the plates of brass and the servant of Laban and departed into the wilderness and journeyed 
          unto the tent of our father and it came to pass that after we had came down into the wilderness
          unto our father behold he was filled with joy and also my mother Sariah was exceeding glad for
          she truly had mourned because of us for she had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness
          and also she had complained against my father telling him that he was a visionary man saying",
          "and after this manner of language had my mother complained against my father and it had came
          to pass that my father spake unto her saying","and after this manner of language did my father
          Lehi comfort my mother Sariah concerning us while we journeyed in the wilderness up to the land
          of Jerusalem to obtain the record of the Jews and when we had returned to the tent of my father
          behold their joy was full and my mother was comforted and she spake saying","and after this 
          manner of language did she speak and it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly and did
          offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord and they gave thanks unto the God of Israel
          my father Lehi took the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass and he did search
          them from the beginning and he beheld that they did contain the five books of Moses which gave
          an account of the creation of the world and also of Adam and Eve which was our first parents
          and also a record of the Jews from the beginning even down to the commencement of the reign of
          Zedekiah king of Judah and also the prophecies of the holy prophets from the beginning even 
          down to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah and also many prophecies which have been 
          spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah and it came to pass that my father Lehi also found upon the 
          plates of brass a genealogy of his fathers wherefore he knew that he was a descendant of Joseph
          yea even that Joseph which was the son of Jacob which was sold into Egypt and which was preserved
          by the hand of the Lord that he might preserve his father Jacob and all his household from 
          perishing with famine and they were also led out of captivity and out of the land of Egypt by 
          that same God who had preserved them and thus my father Lehi did discover the genealogy of his
          fathers and Laban also was a descendant of Joseph wherefore he and his fathers had kept the 
          records and now when my father saw all these things he was filled with the Spirit and began to 
          prophesy concerning his seed that these plates of brass should go forth unto all nations
          kindreds tongues and people which were of his seed wherefore he said that these plates of brass
          should never perish neither should they be dimmed any more by time and he prophesied many things
          concerning his seed and it came to pass that thus far i and my father had kept the commandments
          wherewith the Lord had commanded us and we had obtained the record which the Lord had commanded
          us and searched them and found that they were desirable yea even of great worth unto us
          insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children wherefore it was
          wisdom in the Lord that we should carry them with us as we journeyed in the wilderness toward
          the land of promise and now i Nephi do not give the genealogy of my fathers in this part of my
          record neither at any time shall i give it after upon these plates which i am writing for it is
          given in the reord which was kept by my father wherefore i do not write it in this work for it
          sufficeth me to say that we are a descendant of Joseph and it mattereth not to me that i am 
          particular to give a full account of all the things of my father for they cannot be written 
          upon these plates for i desire the room that i may write of the things of God for the fullness
          of mine intent is that i may persuade men to come unto the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac
          and the God of Jacob and be saved wherefore the things which are pleasing unto the world i do
          not write but the things which are pleasing unto God and unto them which are not of the world
          wherefore i shall give commandment unto my seed that they shall not occupy these plates with 
          things which are not of worth unto the children of men and now i would that ye might know that
          after my father Lehi had made an end of prophesying concerning his seed it came to pass that
          the Lord spake unto him again that it was not meet for him Lehi that he should take his family
          into the wilderness alone but that his sons should take daughters to wife that they might raise
          up seed unto the Lord in the land of promise and it came to pass that the Lord commanded him
          that i Nephi and my brethren should again return into the land of Jerusalem and bring down 
          Ishmael and his family into the wilderness and it came to pass that i Nephi did again with my
          brethren go forth into the wilderness to go up to Jerusalem and it came to pass that we went up
          unto the house of Ishmael and we did gain favor in the sight of Ishmael insomuch that we did
          speak unto him the words of the Lord and it came to pass that the Lord did soften the heart of
          Ishmael and also his whole household insomuch that they took their journey with us down into the
          wilderness to the tent of our father and it came to pass that as we journeyed in the wilderness
          behold Laman and Lemuel and two of the daughters of Ishmael and the two sons of Ishmael and their
          families did rebel against us yea against i Nephi and Sam and their father Ishmael and his wife
          and his three other daughters and it came to pass that in the which rebellion they were desirous
          to return unto the land of Jerusalem and now i Nephi being grieved for the hardness of their 
          hearts therefore i spake unto them saying yea even unto Laman and unto Lemuel behold thou art
          mine elder brethren and how is it that ye are so hard in your hearts and so blind in your minds
          that ye have need that i your younger brother should speak unto you yea and set an example for
          you how is it that ye have not hearkened unto the word of the Lord how is it that ye have 
          forgotten that ye have seen an angel of the Lord yea and how is it that ye have forgotten how
          great things the Lord hath done for us in delivering us out of the hands of Laban and also that
          we should obtain the record yea and how is it that ye have forgotten that the Lord is able to 
          do all things according to his will for the children of men if it so be that they exercise faith
          in him wherefore let us be faithful in him and if it so be that we are faithful in him we shall
          obtain the land of promise and ye shall know at some future period that the word of the Lord
          shall be fulfilled concerning the destruction of Jerusalem for all things which the Lord hath
          spoken concerning the destruction of Jerusalem must be fulfilled for behold the Spirit of the
          Lord ceaseth soon to strive with them for behold they have rejected the prophets and Jeremiah
          have they case into prison and they have sought to take away the life of my father insomuch
          that they have driven him out of the land now behold i say unto you that if ye will return
          unto Jerusalem ye shall also perish with them and now if ye have choice go up to the land and
          remember the words which i speak unto you that if ye go ye will also perish for thus the Spirit
          of the Lord constraineth me that i should speak and it came to pass that when i Nephi had spoken
          these words unto my brethren they were angry with me and it came to pass that they did lay their
          hands upon me for behold they were exceeding wroth and they did bind me with cords for they 
          sought to take away my life that they might leave me in the wilderness to be devoured by wild
          beasts but it came to pass that i prayed unto the Lord saying o Lord according to my faith 
          which is in me wilt thou deliver me from the hands of my brethren yea even give me strength
          that i may burst these bands with which i am bound and it came to pass that when i had said
          these words behold the bands were loosed from off my hands and feet and i stood before my
          brethren and i spake unto them again and it came to pass that they were angry with me again
          and sought to lay hands upon me but behold one of the daughters of Ishmael yea and also her
          mother and one of the sons of Ishmael did plead with my brethren insomuch that they did soften
          their hearts and they did cease striving to take away my life and it came to pass that they 
          were sorrowful because of their wickedness insomuch that they did bow down before me and did
          plead with me that i would forgive them of the thing that they had done against me and it came
          to pass that i did frankly forgive them all that they had done and i did exhort them that they 
          would pray unto the Lord their God for forgiveness and it came to pass that they did so and 
          after that they had done praying unto the Lord we did again travel on our journey toward the
          tent of our father and after that i and my brethren and all the house of Ishmael had come down
          unto the tent of my father they did give thanks unto the Lord their God and they did offer
          sacrifice and burnt offerins unto him and it came to pass that we had gathered together all
          manner of seeds of every kind both of grain of every kind and also of the seeds of fruits of
          every kind and it came to pass that while my father tarried in the wilderness he spake unto us
          saying","and now i Nephi do not speak all the words of my father but to be short in writing
          behold he saw other multitudes pressing forwards and they came and caught hold of the end of
          the rod of iron and they did press their way forward continually holding fast to the rod of
          iron until they came forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree and he also saw
          other multitudes pressing their way towards that great and spacious building and it came to 
          pass that many were drowned in the depths of the fountain and many were lost from his view
          wandering in strange roads and great was the multitude that did enter into that strange building
          and after that they did enter into that building they did point the finger of scorn at ? me ?
          and those that were partaking of the fruit also but we heeded them not thus is the words of 
          my father for as many as heeded them had fallen away and Laman and Lemuel partook not of the 
          fruit saith my father and it came to pass that after my father had spoken all the words of his
          dream or vision which were many he said unto us because of the things which he saw in a vision
          he exceedingly feared for Laman and Lemuel yea he feared lest they should be cast off from the
          presence of the Lord and he did exhort them then with all the feeling of a tender parent that
          they would hearken to his words in that perhaps the Lord would be merciful to them and not 
          cast them off yea my father did preach unto them and after that he had preached unto them and
          also prophesied unto them of many things he bade them to keep the commandments of the Lord and
          he did cease speaking unto them and all these things did my father see and hear and speak as
          he dwelt in a tent in the valley of Lemuel and also a great many more things which cannot be
          written upon these plates and now as i have spoken concerning these plates behold they are not
          the plates upon which i make a full account of the history of my people for the plates upon
          which i make a full account of my people i have given the name of Nephi wherefore they are 
          called the plates of Nephi after mine own name and these plates also are called the plates of
          Nephi nevertheless i have received a commandment of the Lord that i should make these plates
          for the special purpose that there should be an account engraven of the ministry of my people
          and upon the other plates should be engraven an account of the reigns of the kings and the wars
          and contentions of my people wherefore these plates are for the more part of the ministry and
          the other plates are for the more part of the reigns of the kings and the wars and contentions
          of my people wherefore the Lord hath commanded me to make these plates for a wise purpose in
          him which purpose i know not but the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning wherefore he
          prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men for behold he hath all 
          power unto the fulfilling of all his words and thus it is amen and now i Nephi proceed to give
          an account upon these plates of my proceedings and my reign and ministry wherefore to proceed
          with mine account i must speak somewhat of the things of my father and also of my brethren for
          behold it came to pass that after my father had made an end of speaking the words of his dream
          and also of exhorting them to all diligence he spake unto them concerning the Jews how that
          after they were destroyed yea even that great city Jerusalem and that many were carried away 
          captive into Babylon that according to the own due time of the Lord they should return again
          yea even be brought back out of captivity and after that they were brought back out of captivity
          to possess again their land of inheritance yea even six hundred years from the time that my 
          father left Jerusalem a prophet would the Lord God raise up among the Jews yea even a Messiah
          or in other words a Savior of the world and he also spake concerning the prophets how great a
          number had testified of these things concerning this Messiah of which he had spoken or this
          Redeemer of the world wherefore all mankind was in a lost and in a fallen state and ever would
          be save they should rely on this Redeemer and he spake also concerning a prophet which should
          come before the Messiah to prepare the way of the Lord yea even he should go forth and cry in
          the wilderness","and much spake my father concerning this thing and my father saith that he
          should baptize in Bethabara beyond Jordan and he also spake that he should baptize with water
          yea even that he should baptize the Messiah with water and after that he had baptized the 
          Messiah with water he should behold and bear record that he had baptized the Lamb of God which
          should take away the sin of the world and it came to pass that after my father had spoken these
          words he spake unto my brethren concerning the gospel which should be preached among the Jews
          and also concerning the dwindling of the Jews in unbelief and after that they had slain the
          Messiah which should come and after that he had been slain he should rise from the dead and 
          should make himself manifest by the Holy Ghost unto the Gentiles yea even my father spake much
          concerning the Gentiles and also concerning the house of Israel that they should be compared
          like unto an olive tree whose branches should be broken off and should be scattered upon all
          the face of the earth wherefore he said it must needs be that we should be led with one accord
          into the land of promise unto the fulfilling of the word of the Lord that we should be scattered
          upon all the face of the earth and after that the house of Israel should be scattered they 
          should be gathered together again or in fine that after the Gentiles had received the fullness
          of the gospel the natural branches of the olive trees or the remnants of the house of Israel
          should be grafted in or come to the knowledge of the true Messiah their Lord and their Redeemer
          and after this manner of language did my father prophesy and speak unto my brethren and also
          many more things which i do not write in this book for i have written as many of them as were
          expedient for me in mine other book and all these things of which i have spoken was done as my
          father dwelt in a tent in the valley of Lemuel and it came to pass that after i Nephi having 
          heard all the words of my father concerning the things which he saw in a vision and also the
          things which he spake by the power of the Holy Ghost which power he received by faith on the 
          Son of God and the Son of God was the Messiah which should come and it came to pass that i Nephi
          was desirous also that i might see and hear and know of these things by the power of the Holy
          Ghost which is the gift of God unto all those who diligently seek him as well in times of old
          as in he time that he should manifest himself unto the children of men for he is the same 
          yesterday and today and forever and the way is prepared for all men from the foundation of the
          world if it so be that they repent and come unto him for he that diligently seeketh shall find
          and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded to them by the power of the Holy Ghost as well in
          this time as in times of old and as well in times of old as in times to come wherefore the 
          course of the Lord is one eternal round therefore remember o man for all thy doings thou shalt
          be brought into judgement wherefore if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of your 
          probation then ye are found unclean before the judgment seat of God and no unclean thing can
          dwell with God wherefore ye must be cast off forever and the Holy Ghost giveth authority that i
          should speak these things and deny them not for it came to pass that after i had desired to know
          the things that my father had seen and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto
          me wherefore as i sat pondering in mine heart i was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord yea
          into an exceeding high mountain a mountain which i never had before seen and upon which i never
          had before sat my foot and the Spirit saith unto me","and i saith i desire to behold the things
          which my father saw and the Spirit saith unto me","and i said yea thou knowest that i believe
          all the words of my father and when i had spake these words the Spirit cried with a loud voice
          saying","and it came to pass that the Spirit saith unto me","and i looked and beheld a tree and
          it was like unto the tree which my father had seen and the beauty thereof was far beyond yea
          exceeding of all beauty and the whiteness thereof did exceed the whiteness of the driven snow
          and it came to pass that after that i had seen the tree i said unto the Spirit i behold thou 
          hast shewn unto me the tree which is most precious above all and he saith unto me","and i said
          unto him to know the interpretation thereof for i spake unto him as a man speaketh for i beheld
          that he was in the form of a man yet nevertheless i knew that it was the Spirit of the Lord and
          he spake unto me as a man speaketh with another and it came to pass that he said unto me","and
          i looked as if to look upon him and i saw him not for he had gone from before my presence and 
          it came to pass that i looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem and also other cities and
          i beheld the city of Nazareth and in the city of Nazareth i beheld a virgin and she was exceeding
          fair and white and it came to pass that i saw the heavens open and an angel came down and stood
          before me and he saith unto me","and i saith unto him a virgin most beautiful and fair above all 
          other virgins and he saith unto me","and i said unto him i know that he loveth his children
          nevertheless i do not know the meaning of all things and he said unto me","and it came to pass
          that i beheld that she was carried away in the spirit and after that she had been carried away 
          in the spirit for the space of a time the angel spake unto me saying","and i looked and beheld
          the virgin again bearing a child in her arms and the angel said unto me","and i answered him
          saying yea it is the love of God which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of
          men wherefore it is the most desireable above all things and he spake unto me saying","and after
          he had said these words he said unto me","and i looked and i beheld the Son of God a going forth
          among the children of men and i saw many fall down at his feet and worship him and it came to 
          pass that i beheld that the rod of iron which my father had seen was the word of God which led
          to the fountain of living waters or to the tree of life which waters are a representation of
          the love of God and i also beheld that the tree of life was a representation of the love of God
          and the angel said unto me again","and i looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world of which 
          my father had spoken and i also beheld the prophet which should prepare the way before him and
          the Lamb of God went forth and was baptized of him and after that he was baptized i beheld the
          heavens open and the Holy Ghost came down out of heaven and abode upon him in the form of a dove
          and i beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people in power and great glory and the
          multitudes were gathered together to hear him and i beheld that they cast him out from among
          them and i also beheld twelve others following him and it came to pass that they were carried 
          away in the spirit from before my face that i saw them not and it came to pass that the angel
          spake unto me saying","and i looked and i beheld the heavens open again and i saw angels 
          descending upon the children of men and they did minister unto them and he spake unto me again
          saying","and i looked and i beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men and i
          beheld multitudes of people which were sick and which were affliced with all manner of diseases
          and with devils and unclean spirits and the angel spake and shewed all these things unto me and
          they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God and the devils and the unclean spirits were 
          cast out and it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again saying","and i looked and beheld
          the Lamb of God that he was taken by the people yea the everlasting God was judged of the world
          and i saw and bare record and i Nephi saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for 
          the sins of the world and after that he was slain i saw multitudes of the earth that they were
          gathered together to fight against the apostles of the Lamb for thus were the twelve called by
          the angel of the Lord and the multitude of the earth was gathered together and i beheld that 
          they were in a large and spacious building like unto the building which my father saw and the
          angel of the Lord spake unto me saying","and it cae to pass that i saw and bare record that 
          the great and spacious building was the pride of the world and the fall thereof was exceeding
          great and the angel of the Lord spake unto me saying","and it came to pass that the angel said
          unto me","and i looked and beheld the land of promise and i beheld multitudes of people yea 
          even as it were in number as many as the sand of the sea and it came to pass that i beheld 
          multitudes gathered together to battle one against the other and i beheld wars and rumors of 
          wars and great slaughters with the sword among my people and it came to pass that i beheld
          many generations pass away after the manner of wars and contentions in the land and i beheld
          many cities yea even that i did not number them and it came to pass that i saw a mist of darkness
          on the face of the land of promise and i saw lightnings and i heard thunderings and earthquakes
          and all manner of tumultuous noises and i saw the earth that it rent the rocks and i saw mountains
          tumbling into pieces and i saw the plains of the earth that they were broken up and i saw many
          cities that they were sunk and i saw many that they were burnt with fire, and i saw many that 
          they did tumble to the earth because of the quaking thereof and it came to pass that after i 
          saw these things i saw the vapor of darkness that it passed from off the face of the earth and
          behold i saw the multitudes which had not fallen because of the great and terrible judgments of
          the Lord and i saw the heavens open and the Lamb of God descending out of heaven and he came
          down and he shewed himself unto them and i also saw and bare record that the Holy Ghost fell
          upon twelve others and they were ordained of God and chosen and the angel spake unto me saying",

               desirable to make one happy and it came to pass that i did go forth and partook of the
               fruit thereof and beheld that it was most sweet above all that i ever had before tasted

               joy wherefore i began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also for i knew
               that it was desirous above all other fruit and as i cast my eyes around about that perhaps
               i might discover my family also and i beheld a river of water and it ran along and it was

               came to pass that i was desirous that Laman and Lemuel should come and partake of the 
               fruit also wherefore i cast mine eyes toward the head of the river that perhaps i might
               see them but they would not come unto me and partake of the fruit and i beheld a rod of
               iron and it extended along the bank of the river and led to the tree by which i stood and
               i also beheld a straight and narrow path which came along by the rod of iron even to the
               tree by which i stood and it also led by the head of the fountain unto a large and spacious
               field as if it had been a world and i saw numberless concourses of people many of whom were
               pressing forward that they might obtain the path which led unto the tree by which i stood
               and it came to pass that they did come forth and commenced in the path which led to the 
               tree and it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness yea even an exceeding great
               mist of darkness insomuch that they which had commenced in the path did lose their way
               that they wandered off and were lost and it came to pass that i beheld others pressing 
               forward and they cae forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron and they did 
               press forward through the mists of darkness clinging to the rod of iron even until they
               did come forth and partook of the fruit of the tree and after that they had partook of 
               the fruit of the tree they did cast their eyes about as if they were ashamed and i also 
               cast my eyes around about and beheld on the other side of the river of water a great and
               spacious building and it stood as it were in the air high above the earth and it was filled
               with people, both old and young, both male and female, and their manner of dress was 
               exceeding fine and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards
               those which had came up and were partaking of the fruit and after that they had tasted of
               the fruit they were ashamed because of those that were scoffing at them and they fell away
               into forbidden paths and were lost")

BofM.notes.authors = list(JUN112018 = c("I learned something very amazing to me while reading 1 Nephi 10. It talks about 'this Redeemer of the world'--first time in the Book of Mormon. I just listened to to a lesson about Ruth yesterday in church, and thought about what it would have meant to Nephi for someone to be a Redeemer. Then it said 'save they should rely on this Redeemer' they would remain fallen. This the great secret I learned today: It is not a question of whether we can do it alone--get out of our fallen state without relying on a Redeemer. Because, by definition, you can't 'redeem' yourself. If the problem is that you're not married, then no matter how self-reliant and how independent you are, you can't get out of your unmarried state by yourself! It's not just phyiscally, but logically impossible. You're supposed to only be able to be redeemed by joining with another person.",
