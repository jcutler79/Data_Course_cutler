# MASTER LIST OF ALL THE COOLEST R CODE I LEARN AND QUESTIONS I HAVE

# QUESTIONS:
# 1. What can you do about 2 or more data points in a scatter plot of x vs y 
# that are exactly the same? They look like a single data point--you can't 
# tell there's more than one data point there.


# How to change column names
# An example from the cholesterol data:
colnames(M2) <- c("Country","m.t.chol","HDI","meat","milk","eggs","fish","an.fats")
names(M2)
